In this [exercise](/exercises) we take a log file generated by a web server, and
extend the previous exercise [analyzing Apache log files](/exercise-analyze-apache-log-file-count-localhost).


<slidecast file="beginner-perl/exercise-improve-apache-analyzer" youtube="oQTSLam_-xE" />

The task is to write a scrip that will count how many requests came from each different IP address and then
print them in descending order.
