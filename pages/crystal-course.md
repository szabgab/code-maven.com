Learn Crystal with me!

In this series of meetings we are going to learn the [Crystal programming language](https://crystal-lang.org/) together.


I have a lot of background programming and teaching other programming languages and I have been learning Crystal myself since
May 15, 2021. As I learn the language I prepare small examples that eventually become a series of
[slides for the Crystal programming language](/slides/crystal/).
During this course and workshop I'll go over the slides I already have and will create more examples and
more slides as we make progress.

During each session I'll give a presentation and then you'll have time to practice. I'll be around helping you and learning from you!
