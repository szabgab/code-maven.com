After the heavy-lifting of the previous entry in the Daily CI series this was a very easy task. Looking at [CPAN Digger](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/) I saw [MIME-Types](https://metacpan.org/dist/MIME-Types). That sounded like a simple Perl module and indeed adding CI was straight forward.

## Conclusion

There are many projects that are low-hanging fruits where you can add GitHub Actions in a matter of minutes and get the benefits immediately.
