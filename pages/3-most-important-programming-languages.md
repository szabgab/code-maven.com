I am writing a book on [Collaborative Development using Git and GitHub](https://leanpub.com/collab-dev-git/) and
as you might have noticed I write about a lot of stuff on this web site. In order to know which languages should I cover in the book and what subjects should I write about, I asked what are the 3 most important programming languages to my readers.

I meant either languages they already use, languages they'd need to learn, or they'd like to learn.

* Perl 40.2%
* Perl 5 20.9%

## Raw data

The raw data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/blob/main/surveys/3-most-important-programming-languages.csv).

## Background

The survey ran between 2017.10.20-2017.10.30. We got 425 responses.

On 2017.10.20 I sent the out the link to the subscribers of the [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/) site then on 2017.10.23 I've included it in the [326th edition](http://perlweekly.com/archive/326.html) of the [Perl Weekly newsletter](http://perlweekly.com/). Later I've also posted it on [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6328506959322583040) and [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/szabgab/status/922737627572461569) about it.

So a strong bias towards Perl is expected.

During the survey I've added several new items:

* Rust
* Haskell
* Zsh
* Elixir
* Erlang

People also asked for these two, but I have not added them. Maybe next time I run the survey.
* SQL
* PowerShell

In addition, at the beginning there was one item called "Perl" that was later replace by "Perl 5" and "Perl 6".
