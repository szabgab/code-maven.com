Exercise: add more statistics

See other [exercises](/exercises).


Take the solution from the [count sum exercise](/exercise-sum-of-numbers-in-file) where we added up the numbers in each row of a file,
and add additional statistical values:

* minumum
* maximum
* average

If you are following the [exercises](/exercises) then caluclating median and standard deviation might too difficult at this point, but you can give them a try.
