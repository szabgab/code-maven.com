Job-search is not easy, especially now with the Corona-virus. In this webinar series I am trying to help you by showing you
the point of view of the recruiters, HR, head-hunters, and in general the side of the companies doing the hiring.

I think if you can see their side of the hiring-table, then you can improve your chances to get a job. You'll know how to
improve your LinkedIn page and how you use LinkedIn. How to improve your CV, your searching strategy etc.

You'll also hear about the hiring process of each company and what are they really looking for in a new employee.

## Background

* It is a live webinar via Zoom which is recorded and uploaded to YouTube (and maybe other places).
* I schedule the webinar to be 1 hour long but we can stop any time earlier and we can also stay on the webinar a bit longer if necessary.

## Some of my questions / topic for discussion

Some of the questions I thought that might be relevant for the webinar.

Take them as the general directions and add your point of view!

* Tell me about yourself and about the company you work for!
* What does the hiring process look like at your firm? How long does it take? How many interviews?
* Are all of your open positions advertised publicly? If not how do you fill the others?
* Is it a good idea to contact you directly if I am interested in a position at your firm?
* Should I look for someone who works at the same place to recommend me? Is it better to submit my resume via LinkedIn or directly to you or some other way?
* How do you determine who you contact via LinkedIn? What features of the profile are you looking for? Do the recommendations matter? The skills? The activities?
* If I am looking for a job right now, what can I do to improve my chances?
* Can I do anything to improve my position in your eyes?
* How important is a degree vs. experience in the field?
* If I have never had a fixed job in the industry before how can I get my first job? (e.g. if I just finished my degree, but have never worked in the industry or I was working in some unrelated field and I am trying to switch.)
* Is there any way I can gain experience without having a job? How do you view home made projects? How do you view contributions to open source projects?
* How should I prepare for an interview?
* If I really like your company and I'd like to be able to apply for a job to you 2-5 years from now, what do you recommend I do now and in the next few years?
* Alternatively: If you could go back 2-5 years what would you have suggested I do so you would want to hire me for one of your open positions?
* Show us how you search and what you think during your search. You can bring an existing open position you are looking for, a past one, or a made up one and then show us your process.
* What do you think about gaps in employment? How would you represent them on your LinkedIn profile and in your CV?
* Do you ask people about their salary expectation? When I am asked about my salary expectation what shall I say?

* The viewers will be able to ask questions and share their LinkedIn profile via the chat.
* We can ask the viewers to share a link to their CV (not just LinkedIn) and review that.
* We'll try to answer these questions.
* We will provide our point of view on selected LinkedIn profiles shared by the audience.

## What are your questions?

* If you have any other question you would have asked yourself, let me know!

## Technical aspects

* We will have a Zoom webinar. I'll be the "host" and you the "panelist".
* People in the audience will be able to see and hear us and we'll be able to share our screen. They won't see what we write in the chat.
* People in the audience will be able to write in the chat, but they will not be able to speak or share their screen.
* Only we (host and panelists) will see the chat.
* At the end we will tell people to connect with us, to follow us, or to subscribe to our channels.
* We'll also include the appropriate links in the notes of the video recording.
* The recorded video is uploaded (probably as it is) to YouTube and maybe to other places.
* Later I might create shorter videos based on parts of the video. E.g. a question and the answer to it. Shorter videos might have a higher chance of being watched.
