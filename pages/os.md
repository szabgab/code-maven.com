## How to find Open Source projects

A few ideas on how to find projects to contribute to.

* Python: On [PyDigger](https://pydigger.com/) find projects that have [Link to GitHub, but no CI](https://pydigger.com/search/has-github-no-ci)
* Perl: The [CPAN Digger](https://github.com/szabgab/CPAN-Digger) project has a script called bin/cpan-digger that can create a report with some logs of recently uploaded Perl modules.
* In general: Visit the [Explore topics](https://github.com/topics) page of GitHub, select a topic, select the language, sort by "Recently uploaded". In the list look for projects with few stars. They are probably the newer
ones with less things already in place. For example this is the link for [Go](https://github.com/topics/go?l=go&o=desc&s=updated)
