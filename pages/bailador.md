[Bailador](https://github.com/bailador) was a light-weight web framework that is written in the [Raku programming language](/raku).

I contributed a bit to that project and created the web site of the project, but the project is not maintained any more and the website was shut down.

In any case you can find the sources in the [Bailador GitHub project](https://github.com/bailador).
