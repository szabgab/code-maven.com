Pete Sergeant is a Developer Manager turned recruiter who runs the [Perl Careers](https://perl.careers/)
and [CareersJS](https://careersjs.com/). If you are the reader of the [Perl Weekly newsletter](https://perlweekly.com/)
(edite by yours truly) then you have seen his job posts at the bottom of each edition.
(Well, we had a break during the heights of the Corona virus pandemic, but he is back with his job offers.)
