Having a single and central remote repository for a project means that either we give everyone read and write access to the whole repository or we have to maintain some access control.

The former might work for high trusting teams, but it will be problematic if


```perl
```

<img src="/img/" alt="" />

<include file="">
<try file="">

git remote prune origin
