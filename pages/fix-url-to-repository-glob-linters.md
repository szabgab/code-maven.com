While looking for another Python project to add CI to, I encountered the [glob-linters](https://github.com/bowentan/glob-linters/) project
that and incorrect GitHub URL in its configuration files. So before I even get to check if it has tests I went
ahead and fixed the URL.


The video started at the [PyDigger](https://pydigger.com/) project.
