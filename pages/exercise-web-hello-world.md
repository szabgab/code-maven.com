The first exercise for building web applications.


Write a "web application" that will display **Hello World**.
The first one should be a plain HTML file without any code behind it.


Before going on do the above and then see the [plain HTML solution](/hello-world-in-plain-html).

Then pick your favorite back-end web development environment and write some code that will return the same HTML
created earlier. Each soultion should have several versions:

1. Just return the string "Hello World!".
1. Return the HTML 5 version of "Hello World!"
1. Write version in which there is a template with a placeholder for "text" and the code fills that placeholder with the string "Hello World!".
