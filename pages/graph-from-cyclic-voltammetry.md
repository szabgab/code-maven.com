One of the experiments we do all the time is called "cyclic voltammetry", or CV for short.
The experiment involves several repetitions of the measurement (several cycles), but when we share our data we only want to display one of the cycles, to make the graph clear.
These days the extraction of the relevant cycle is done manually by manipulating excel to sort data by the column 'cycle number' and then manually selecting the values of interest.

The solution:

The users can run the code in google colab, it asks them for the CSV files and the required cycle number, and it prints the appropriate figure!
