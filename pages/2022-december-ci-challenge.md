[Advent Calendars](https://dev.to/szabgab/advent-calendars-in-2022-1kic) and [Advent Code Challenges](https://dev.to/jarvisscript/2022-advent-code-challenges-5445)
are all the rage these days.

I am going to combine the ideas and write an article every day on how I configured Continuous Integration for an Open Source project
and I would like to <b>challenge you</b> to do the same!



This is going to be a series of articles (and videos) on setting up Continuous Integration (CI) for Open Source projects.

Each day during December 2022 (well, at least till the 25th) I am going to configure CI for an open source project.

Every day I'll try to find something different. A different programming language,
a different VCS hosting service, maybe some different extras that are needed (a database, etc.)

However this challenge is not only for me. I hope that you will also join me on this crazy journey,
find a project that does not have CI yet, write some test if there are non, set up the CI, send the pull-request,
and then post a link to it as a comment on the days post.

The VCS hosting services: I know most of the open source projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
A lot less on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). I'd be glad to hear about other hosting services where there are
Open Source projects.

Where can you find projects? You can search for them on the web site of the VCS hosting service or on one of the digger
projects I've been building. The currently existing projects are <a href="https://pydigger.com/">PyDigger for Python,
[CPAN Digger](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/) for Perl, and the [Ruby Digger](https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/).
