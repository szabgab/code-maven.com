Most of the major programming languages have lots of open source extensions. Many of the development frameworks also have
packages. Even some of the editors and IDEs have such extensions.

These extensions are sometimes referred to as modules or libraries or packages.

Sometime they get a different name.



[Module counts](http://www.modulecounts.com/) show the list of all the module/package/library systems and the number of items in them.

Here I tried to replicate and extend that list.

## C++ seems to be a category of itself

[Jakub NarÄ™bski](https://github.com/jnareb) wrote me:

The C++ language does not come with an integrated package manager to deal with external dependencies of a project.
However, there exists various third party package managers for C++ with their package repositories:

* [Conan](https://conan.io/) with [ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center/) with 867 packages
* [build2](https://build2.org/) with [cppget](https://cppget.org/) with 83 packages
* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) with [Wrap DB](https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com/) with 163 packages (recipes)
* [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) from Microsoft with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/packages.html) with 1656 packages

## Frameworks

* [Django (Python)](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/)
* [Drupal (PHP)](https://www.drupal.org/) - [Drupal modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module)
* [Laravel (PHP)](https://laravel.com/) - [Packalyst](https://packalyst.com/)

## Editors
