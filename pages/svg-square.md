This is part of the [SVG Tutorial and exercises](/svg) drawing square in SVG.


<script src="/try/examples/js/svg.min.js"></script>

Actually a square is just a [rectangular](/svg-rectangular) where all the 4 sides are the same length,
but the color is much nicer here.

<div id="square_1"></div>

<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_square.js"></script>

{% include file="examples/js/svg_square.js" %}
