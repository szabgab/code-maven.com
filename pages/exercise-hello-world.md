First [exercise](/exercises) - checking your environment.


<slidecast file="beginner-perl/exercise-hello-world" youtube="t2ria8wh6Dg" />

Try your environment:

* Make sure you have access to the right version of your language. Pick the language you are currently learning from the below list:
     <ul>
* Perl 5: As of this writing version 5.30 is already out, but most of the material will work on 5.10 and even 5.8, if you cannot upgrade. (See the [most recent release of Perl 5](https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html).)
* Raku (formerly known as Perl 6): See the [most recent version of Raku](https://rakudo.org/) (that was 2019.03 when I updated this).
* Ruby: 2.5.x will be fine. Check out the [most recent version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
* Python: In case you have Python 2 (e.g. 2.7.x) you should strongly consider switching to Python 3. Even though if you need to maintain legacy code then you might need to know Python 2 as well.
* In the Python 3 series any of 3.8.x is the most recent, but most of the examples will work on older versions of Python 3 as well. See the [most recent version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Go version go1.12.9 looks fine. The you could get the [most recent version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/).
     </ul>
  
* Check you can read the documentation.
<!--
    <ul>
* Perl 5: perldoc
    </ul>
-->
  
* Check if you have a good editor with syntax highlighting.
* Write a simple script that prints     "Hello world!".
* Add comments to your code.
* Add user documentation to your code.
