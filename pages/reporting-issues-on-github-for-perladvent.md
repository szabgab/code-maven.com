[GitHub](https://github.com/) is used by many Open Source projects and corporations. In this video you can see
how to report issues (bug, errors) with an Open Source project. We happen to look at the web site of a Perl-based project,
but the same thing is relevant for any Open Source project and also any in-hous project that uses GitHub.
