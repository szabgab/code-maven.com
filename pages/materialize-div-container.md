Probably in every project built using [Materialize](/materialize) all the content is wrapped in a `div` element with a `class` called `container`.
In this example we can see it being used.
The sample content is from [Lorem Ipsum](https://lipsum.com/).

Removing this `div` element or removing the `container` class from it will make the site take up the full width of the browser.
Check the [skeleton](/materialize-skeleton) to see it.

For more details see the beginning of documentation of the [grid](https://materializecss.com/grid.html) where this is mentioned.
