There are plenty of organizations that use Continuous Integration Systems and a lot that don't.
In this 1-question survey I asked what do you use if anything at all?
Multiple selections were welcome as we know some people and some organizations use several CI systems.


There is also a form where you can subscribe to the "Code-Maven Surveys" newsletter. I am going to send out the results of this survey in that newsletter and the call for the next survey when I run that. Otherwise I won't spam you.

## Raw data

The raw data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/blob/main/surveys/continuous-integration-systems.csv).

## Background

The survey ran between 2017.10.30-2017.11.09. We got 238 responses.

The survey was sent to the subscribers of the [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/)  and[Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/)  sites.
It was included it in the [327th edition](http://perlweekly.com/archive/327.html) of the [Perl Weekly newsletter](http://perlweekly.com/).
I've Tweeted about it, posted on LinkedIn and on reddit.com/r/programming, but after a few hours I've removed it from there.
