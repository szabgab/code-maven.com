Adding CI to Perl modules is usually quite easy as the way to install dependencies and the way to test them is almost fully standardized.
True, there are 3-4 different standards, but it is quite easy to see which standard you have.

As always I started at the [CPAN Digger](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/). This time found the [Log-Any](https://metacpan.org/dist/Log-Any)
distribution.

Simple is good for work. Less exciting for the blog. Check out the previous entries of this series if you'd like to find more exciting cases.
