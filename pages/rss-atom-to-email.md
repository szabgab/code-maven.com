Part of the project ideas for people who would like to [practice programming](/exercises).


Pick and RSS or Atom feed and write a script that will fetch the feed, parse the content and send an e-mail with the extracted content
if it matches some pre-defined expression.

For Ruby try the [Atom feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/gemcutter-latest) of [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/).
and send an e-mail to yourself listing all the recently uploaded gems that have the letter 'r' in their name.
