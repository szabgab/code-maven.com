Continuous Integration (commonly known as CI and usually talked about as part of a CI/CD pipeline) is one of the
most valuable features you can add to your software development process. The major git-hosting platforms
provide free, cloud-based CI running service, but there also various tools to set up in-house CI systems.

I provide help to individuals and teams with training, techniques, and tools for test automation, CI, and CD.


I try to help Open Source projects with the same services. This is helped by my [supporters](https://szabgab.com/support.html).
Both individuals and corporations.

In a separates series you can read and watch small [contributions to Open Source projects](/os).
Mostly configuring CI systems and adding automated tests.
