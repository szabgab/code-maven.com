There are tons of possiblities to have counters depending on how do you access it and where does it keep the score.
In this exercise you are required to implement a number of different counters.
A few ideas follow:


A command-line single-counter. Every time we run the program it will display an ever increasing number:

<pre>
$ counter
1
$ counter
2
$ counter
3
</pre>

A command-line multi-counter:

<pre>
$ counter Foo
1
$ counter Foo
2
$ counter Bar
1
$ counter Foo
3
$ counter Foo
4
$ counter Bar
2
</pre>

Front-ends:

* Command line
* Web browser
* GUI (e.g. Python Tk)



You can find many solutions in the [Counter Examples](/counter) project.
