A programming language is just a simple language (like any written human language) with a very limited set of words and a very strict grammar.

In a human language if we make a slight mistake the listener or reader can usually still understand what we meant. Usually based on the context.
(e.g. people mixing choose an chose).

Computer programs are very strict and if you misplace a comma, and sometimes even a space, it might break your code.
In the lucky case it will stop your program from running, in the not-so-lucky case it will change the meaning of your code.
The latter is worse because then you still get an answer from the computer, it is just the wrong answer.
So you might not notice for a long time that your code does not behave as you intended.

Each programming language comes with a tool (usually called compiler or interpreter) that will check the syntax of your code and will give you error messages
if it does not understand something. Most programming languages also have other tools that go beyond the syntax check to
help you write "good code". (Whatever that might be) These tools are usually called static analyzers, or linters.

A program is built up of
[Literal values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)) (numbers, strings),
[operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)) ( some you might be familiar from math + - * / < >   others might not , ++, +=, == )
The meaning of these operators will vary and they might have different meanings in different contexts in the programming language.

[Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) that contain values or are names that refer to some place in memory where we have the value. (think as a box that can contain some value has a name)
We can do operations on.

[Functions (aka. subroutines, procedures)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine).

Classes.
