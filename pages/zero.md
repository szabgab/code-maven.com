This is the first post, but as with most of the programming languages we start to count from zero...


I should write something very deep here, after all I am starting a new site, and I am planning
to write about everything. Well, almost everything. I'll probably won't write much about the
Perl programming language, as I am writing about
it on the [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/) site.


I used to write a lot on the Perl Maven and by today, it
attracts quite a few readers every day, but I wanted to extend the content to cover all kinds
of other languages and technologies. I was wondering if I should just add those articles
to the Perl Maven site, but in then end I think it would be better to have a site that does
not contain any programming language in its name.

Anyway, let's get started.
