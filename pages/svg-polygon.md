This is part of the [SVG Tutorial and exercises](/svg) drawing a Polygon in SVG.


<script src="/try/examples/js/svg.min.js"></script>

<div id="polygon_1"></div>
<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_polygon_1.js"></script>
{% include file="examples/js/svg_polygon_1.js" %}

A polygon is very similar to a [Polyline](/svg-polyline), but it is a closed
shape. The last point in the list of points is connected back to the first point.

In this example we provided 4 points and got some strange shape.
