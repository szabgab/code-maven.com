Create a command line calucaltor that will prompt for two numbers and an operator
and will calculate the result. Handle the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.


An interaction should look like this:

<pre>
$ mycalc
First number: 23
Second number: 19
Operator: +
Result: 42
</pre>

where the numbers 23, 19 and the operator + are typed in by the user.
