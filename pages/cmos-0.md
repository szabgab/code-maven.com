The first edition, in which I (Gabor Szabo) try to explain what is this going to be and why you would want to listen to it.

Hello there.

My name is Gabor Szabo. Some of you might be already familiar with me.
I have been quite active in the Perl community for many years.
I have even recorded a few interviews with some Perl celebrities.

Besides Perl I've been doing quite a lot of other things, but I have not talked
about those enough and I always felt that I 

In the last couple of years I've started to take some extreme steps to diversify my knowledge that
I can offer to my clients.

Part ofand I've been listening to a lot of podcasts and found this
as a great way to learn about things. Especially while I drive to one of my clients
or when I do my regular walking-insted-of-real-exercise. Actualy that's quite nice.
I find some nature where I can walk or you might even call it hike and at least some of the
time I listen to podcast.

There are a number of podcasts I like, but let me just mention the [ChangeLog](https://changelog.com/)
and their recent addition [RFC - Request For Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc/). These are really great
in-depth interviews with leaders in Open Source projects.
There is really only one problem with these interviews. That there aren't enough of them.

I would love to hear about a lot more projects.

So I thought to myself, I could do it myself. I could go out an interview lots of other people involved in many other
open source projects. Unfortunately noone would be able to listen to an hour long podcast every day. So I am doing a 
different format.

I plan to provide a platform for open source projects to distribute news about themselves via a podcast.
I hope to find representatives of open source projects, not necessarily the main developers, who are enthusiastic
about the project and who woould be interested in talking about it for a few minutes.
Then I can creates series of podcasts for each project. The first time I interview someone I'd have a 10-20 minute
long interview where the people can intocude themselves and the project. Then a few months later we can re-visit
the same project and have a 5-10 minutes long interview. Just to hear to new exciting features of the project.

That way I could have an episode every day and you could listen to it even if you only have very short free time.

Once I had this idea, I started to worry. Will I be able to create something of high quality?
People who listen to podcasts such as the ChangeLog are already used to experienced
interviewers who are not nerveous while condacting the interviews and who can ask really good questions.
Even if I can fake that, people will expect superb sound quality.

I was wondering how can I make sure I have a perfect podcast.

It took me several weeks, and a chat with a friend, to get to the conclusion: I should not worry.
I need to accept that at first I'll make mistakes and the sound won't be eally good. I just need to get started.
That's how I can gain experience and I can gradually improve, both the personal and the technical aspects
of the interviews.

I've started with
