[Meta::CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) is the location where you can read the documentation of all the 3rd-party Perl modules.


One of the most satisfying Open source contribution is to a site that live. Once your contribution is accepted and goes live
it will be immediatly be usde by millions of people.
I have a list of [live web sites with Open Source code-base](/live-web-site-with-editable-open-source-code).
