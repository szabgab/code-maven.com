Contribution to Open Source web application is an excellent way to learn about technology.

See also: [Live web sites with Open Source code](/live-web-site-with-editable-open-source-code).


* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)  written in PHP
* [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/) would be just another wiki among the thousand others, but Wikipedia runs on it so contributing to it will have a huge impact. It is written in PHP and uses MySQL as the database behind it. There is a separate page describing [how to contribute](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_contribute).
* [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) is a messaging system, an Open Source Slack, if you wish. The back-end is written in Go, but it also has a mobile and a web client, so you have plenty of opportunities to learn and to get involved.
* [Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) an rss and atom feed collector with a web interface. It is written in PHP and uses PostgreSQL as the database behind it.
* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) is a web-based project management application. It is written using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database. The only big drawback for contribution is that they are still using Subversion for version control.
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is a web-based automation system often used to set up CI/CD pipelines. It is one of the commonly used systems in case you need an on-premise solution or for some other reason you cannot use the cloud-based CI services. It is written in Java and they have a page on how to [participate](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/).
* [IntraMine](http://intramine.info/) indexer and search tool for all the files you have in your organization. Written in Perl. Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/KLB7/IntraMine)

Maybe [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_web_applications) can help.
