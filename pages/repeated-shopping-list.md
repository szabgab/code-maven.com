A shopping list application for buying in a Supermarket where we often buy the same items.

In this system we will have a "master list" where we only have the types of items. Each item can be either without the amount or with the range of amounts based on our past purchases.

When the user wants to start a new purchase s/he can do so either from an empty list, from the list of all the items in the master list or a list from a previous purchase.

The user can add new items to the current list. These items are also automatically added to the "master list".

The user can change the amount of each item in the current list. The user can also remove items from the current list.

The user can also direct add/remove items in the "master list".

There can can be other users in the system who can suggest items to the current list. (e.g. the kids want to get sweets). The main person will see who suggested each iterm.
