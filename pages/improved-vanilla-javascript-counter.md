This code is part of the [counter example](/counter) project. It is an impoved version of the [Vanilla JavaScript counter](/vanilla-javascript-counter) I posted a while ago.
This version was posted by [Jon Randy](https://dev.to/jonrandy) as a reply to my [post on dev.to](https://dev.to/szabgab/counter-example-vanilla-javascript-1n6l).



{% include file="examples/javascript/improved-vanilla-javascript-counter.html" %}

A few notes as I am trying to understand this example:

* The <b>value</b> attribute of an <b>input</b> element of <b>type="button"</b> is the value shown by the browser on the button.
* I am still not used to the fat-arrow notation of creating anonymous functions in JavaScript that are then assigned to a variable. <b>() => code</b> is a function definition.

It is indeed a very nice use of the various default capabilities of HTML and JavaScript.
