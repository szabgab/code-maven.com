In this [live pair programming](/live) session
[Thomas Klausner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-klausner-40079/) (aka. [domm](https://metacpan.org/author/DOMM))
and myself worked on the "DevOps aspects" of the
[course management application](https://perlmaven.com/course-management-app-in-mojolicious).

We created a Docker container for the project. A docker-compose file and set up GitHub Actions for CI.
