On this site we cover a number of DevOps-related topics.
For example [Docker](/docker), [Jenkins](/jenkins)
[Ansible](/ansible), and [Git](/git). Just to name a few.


There are also pages about [Groovy](/groovy), the language used in Jenkins.


You can find other, more generic topics such as [Linux](/linux), [Bash](/shell), and [Python](/python).

We also have video recordings, for example the one with [Rachael Bates, SRE at Adobe](/site-reliability-engineer-at-adobe-rachael-bates).

Some of our content is only [available to paying subscribers](https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=pro), but some of those
are always available to [preview](https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=preview).
You only need to [register](/pm/register) on the site to get access to the videos in preview mode.

If you are not interested registering here you can get DevOps-related tips 3-5 times a week by following our
[DevOps specific LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/)
and/or our [YouTube channel](/youtube) where we have a mix of technical videos and webinar recordings.
