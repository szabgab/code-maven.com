[YAML](http://yaml.org/) that stands for <b>YAML Ain't Markup Language</b> is a human friendly data serialization format with implementations in many programming languages. (See [Wikipedia on YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).)

It is similar to [JSON](/json), but looks much nicer and much more readable.

It is usually used for configuration files that need more power that an INI file.


## Example

This is a sample configuration file used for the code running the Code Maven web site:

{% include file="examples/data/code_maven_config.yml" %}

## Implementations and examples

* [YAML in Perl](https://perlmaven.com/yaml)
* [Python](/python)
* [Ruby](/ruby)
* [PHP](/php)
* [Java](/java)
* [JavaScript](/javascript)
* [NodeJS](/nodejs)
