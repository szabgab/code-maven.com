[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a JavaScript framework that enhances HTML.

Here you'll find a few simple examples using AngularJS, slowly building up to become a Tutorial.

For other introductions you might want to look at the [AngularJS Book](http://www.angularjsbook.com/) by Chris Smith
or the [ng-book](https://www.ng-book.com/) by Ari Lerner. Once you get over the first steps, reading the
[AngularJS API and documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/) becomes quite useful.
