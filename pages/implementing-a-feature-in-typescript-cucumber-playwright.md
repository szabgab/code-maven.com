In this live session [Tally Barak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tallybarak/) and myself worked on her [cucumber-playwright](https://github.com/Tallyb/cucumber-playwright) project
implementing a [feature request](https://github.com/Tallyb/cucumber-playwright/issues/60).


At the begining Tally introduced the tools in the project starting with [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) from where many of the enegineers
working on [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) came from.

We talked about [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) and in general about BDD.

See also the [repository of cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber) and a  [reference of Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

Tally has a number of [blog posts on Medium](https://tally-b.medium.com/) about the subject. e.g
[5 Ways Playwright is Awesome](https://tally-b.medium.com/5-ways-playwright-is-awesome-b94eff4da0ea) and
[E2E Testing with Cucumber and Playwright](https://tally-b.medium.com/e2e-testing-with-cucumber-and-playwright-9584d3ef3360).

We used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and learned that you can set environment varibles on the command line of MS Windows using

```
set NAME=value
```
