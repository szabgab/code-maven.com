<include file="examples/python/commafy.py">

We have imported the <hl>print_function</hl> from the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html">__future__</a>
so this code will work on both Python 2 and Python 3.

The key here is the <hl>{:,}</hl> placeholder.

<h2>Commafy in Jinja and Flask</h2>

We can create new filters for Jinja and add them to the environment:

<include file="examples/python/jinja-commafy/generate_from_filesystem.py">

In the template we can filter values using this new filter:

<include file="examples/python/jinja-commafy/page.html">

The output will look like this:

<code>
12345678

12,345,678
</code>
