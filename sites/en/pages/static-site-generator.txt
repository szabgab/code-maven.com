There are plenty of Static Site Generator (SSGs) already, but it is also a fun project to implement as an exercise.

=abstract end

A few of the most popular SSGs are
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> written in Ruby</li>
    <li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> written in Go</li>
    <li><a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a></li>
</ul>

Jamstack has a <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">collection of 347 SSGs</a> with various details categorized by language.

<h2>Description</h2>

<b>Version 1</b>: The user writes Markdown files and the proccsor generates HTML pages.

<b>Version 2</b>: The Markdown files can have some meta data at the top of the file. E.g called "front matter" Similar to what <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a> allows.

The <b>title</b> is going to be both the HTML <b>title</b> tag in the head and the <b>h1</b> element of the page.

The articles that have <b>published: true</b> are actually published. The ones that have <b>published: false</b> are considered drafts.

The <b>published_at</b> field can be used to create a page listing all the articles in the order the were published.

The generated front page could display the 3 most recently published articles.

The <b>description</b> can be the content of the HTML <b>meta</b> tag called <b>description</b>. (Look at the source of the current page.)

The <b>tags</b> can be used to crete pages, eg. <b>t/some</b> listing all the articles that have the same tag. There can also be a page called <b>/tags</b> listing all the tags and the number of articles with that tag.

<b>Version 3</b>:

Add a config file e.g. <b>config.yaml</b> that will contain some configuration information about the whole site. e.g.

<code>
title: The title of the site (on the main page)
front_limit: 3    (The number of articles to show on the front page)
