Today I was quite busy and first worked on some other project that I hope will be done in a few days, but I also managed
to add CI to a relatively simple Python package called <a href="https://github.com/Ara101/pcr_optimizer/">pcr_optimizer</a>

=abstract end

When I first added GitHub Actions it failed to install the dependencies lister in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file with a
nasty error:

I recalled seeing this already, but I was not sure where. It looked like a Python 2 vs. Python 3 issue and started to scratch my head.

Then I noticed it is trying to install the <b>logging</b> module which comes with Python. There is no need to install.
Maybe it was not coming with early versions of Python 2 ? I don't know. I think it was part of Python since I am using Python.

Anyway, I removed <b>logging</b> from the <b>requirements.txt</b> file.

I also had to set the <b>PYTHONPATH</b> environment variable to let the tests find the module.

Finally, I noticed that <b>__pycache__</b> was generated while I ran the tests on my computer. So I added it to the <b>.gitignore</b> file
to make sure this folder is not added to github by mistake.

That's it. The tests passed and I sent the <a href="https://github.com/Ara101/pcr_optimizer/pull/4">Pull-Request</a>.

Here is the configuration file:

<include file="examples/pcr_optimizer/ci.yml">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Sometimes you need to make slight changes for the CI to start working.
