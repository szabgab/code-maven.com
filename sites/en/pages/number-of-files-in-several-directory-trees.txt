We already know how to <a href="https://code-maven.com/number-of-files-in-a-directory-tree">Show number of files in a single directory tree using Shell</a>, but what if given a directory,
we would like to know the number of files in each one of its subdirectories separately?

=abstract end

We assume the same directory structure as in that other article:

<code>
groups/
  all.txt
  people/
    John.txt
    Jane.txt
  maskots/
    Foo.txt
    Bar.txt
  other -> maskots
</code>

In the <a href="https://code-maven.com/number-of-files-in-a-directory-tree">previous article</a>
we reached this solution for a single directory:

<code lang="bash">
$ find groups -type f | wc -l
</code>

Now we need to go over all the subdirectories and run the above expression for each one of them.

<h2>Wildecard expansion</h2>

In our first attempt we use the wildecard expansion <hl>groups/*</hl> to list all the
item in the "groups" directory. We go over it in a <hl>for</hl> loop and for each iteration
we echo the name of the thing and call the above expression.

<code lang="bash">
$ for x in  groups/*; do (echo $x; find $x -type f | wc -l) ; done

groups/all.txt
1
groups/maskots
2
groups/other
0
groups/people
2
</code>

The  output includes the directories 'maskots' and 'people' as we wanted, but it
also includes "all.txt" which is a plain file and 'other' which is a symbolic link.

<h2>Find with backtick</h2>

We can use <hl>find</hl> here too with <hl>type</hl> directory and <hl>maxdepth</hl> 1,
but that will return the root directory as well:

<code lang="bash">
$ find groups -maxdepth 1 -type d

groups
groups/maskots
groups/people
</code>

In this case we can also include <hl>mindepth</hl> to make sure only the right depth is included:


<code lang="bash">
$ find groups -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d

groups/maskots
groups/people
</code>

Using this we can now write:

<code lang="bash">
$ for x in  `find groups -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d`; do (echo $x; find $x -type f | wc -l) ; done

groups/maskots
       2
groups/people
       2
</code>


<h2>Using result interpolation</h2>

Instead of the backticks <hl>``</hl>, it is usually better to write <hl>$()</hl>.
The result is the same:

<code lang="bash">
$ for x in  $(find groups -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d ); do (echo $x; find $x -type f | wc -l) ; done

groups/maskots
       2
groups/people
       2
</code>
