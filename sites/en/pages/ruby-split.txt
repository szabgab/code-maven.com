=abstract start

<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">String</a> objects in Ruby have a method called
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-split">split</a>. It is similar to the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/perl-split">split function of Perl</a>. It can cut up a string into
pieces along a pre-defined string or regex returning an array of smaller strings.

=abstract end

In the first example you can see how to split a string every place where there is a comma <hl>,</hl>:

<include file="examples/ruby/split_comma.rb">


In the second example we use a Regex to match the places where we would like to cut up the string.
It makes the splitting much more flexible:

<include file="examples/ruby/split_regex.rb">


<h2>Split with limit</h2>

We can pass a second parameter to <hl>split</hl> that will limit the number of reurned valus.
If we pass 3, then split will make two cuts and return the results:

<include file="examples/ruby/split_comma_limit.rb">

<h2>Split by empty string</h2>

As a slightly special case, if we use an empty string (or empty regex) to split with,
then we will get back an array of the individual characters:

<include file="examples/ruby/split_by_empty_string.rb">
