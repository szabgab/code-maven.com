=abstract start

The <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars JavaScript</a> templating engine provide a single <hl>if</hl>-conditional with an optional <hl>else</hl>,
but that <hl>if</hl>-statement can only handle a single value, not an expression. You can write

<code>
{{#if name}}
..
{{/if}}
</code>

but you cannot write

<code>
{{#if name == 'Foo'}}
..
{{/if}}
</code>

Let's create a <a href="/handlebars-helpers">Handlebars helper</a> that will provide this functionality.

=abstract end

<h2>if conditional</h2>

Before creating the helper though, let's see a full example using the plain <hl>if</hl> statement.
There are two values in the data object: cond1 and cond2, true and false respectively. The rest of the
JavaScript code is just fetching the template and letting Handlebars process the data.

<include file="examples/js/handlebars_if.js">

The template itself has two entries like this using each one of the variables:

<code>
{{#if cond1}}
    true
{{else}}
    false
{{/if}}
</code>

The full html code is this:

<try file="examples/js/handlebars_if.html">

You can try it by clicking on the Try link. In the new page the "show" button will trigger the process.

<h2>if_eq</h2>

In the next example we have implemented a <a href="/handlebars-helpers">Handlebars helper</a> called
<hl>if_eq</hl>. It expects two parameters and will compare them using <hl>==</hl>.
The helper itself looks like this:

<code lang="javascript">
Handlebars.registerHelper('if_eq', function(a, b, opts) {
    if (a == b) {
        return opts.fn(this);
    } else {
        return opts.inverse(this);
    }
});
</code>

The template using this looks like this: (<hl>name</hl> is an attribute passed to the <hl>template</hl> function.)

<code>
{{#if_eq name 'Foo'}}
      true
{{else}}
      false
{{/if_eq}}
</code>

The full JavaScript file also contains the data object and the
code we had earlier combining the template with the data:

<include file="examples/js/handlebars_helpers_if_eq.js">

The full HTML file including the template looks like this:

<try file="examples/js/handlebars_helpers_if_eq.html">

You can try it after clicking on the "Try" link.

<h2>Uncaught Error: if_eq doesn't match if - 3:7</h2>

When I encountered this error it took me quite a while to figure out what went wrong.
It might have been just something blocking my mind, I am not sure. Can you spot the  problem in the next example:

<try file="examples/js/handlebars_helpers_if_eq_typo.html">

This happened when I started to convert my <hl>if</hl> conditional to an <hl>if_eq</hl> conditional, but I only changed the opening
expression from <hl>{{#if ...}}</hl> to <hl>{{#if_eq ...}}</hl> but not the closing expression that was left as <hl>{{/if}}</hl>.
Hence the error telling us that <hl>if_eq</hl> does not match <hl>if</hl>. Maybe if the error message had the keywords stand out,
it would have been easier.

Anyway, look out for such typos. They are a waste of time. Make some more interesting bugs!

<h2>iff - for other conditionals</h2>

Finally we got to build the more generic helper for conditional expressions. I called it <hl>iff</hl>. I am aware of the mathematical
meaning of it, but it just looked cute and short to be used for a generic comparision helper. The idea is that I'd like to
be able to write expressions like these:

<code>
    {{#iff name '==' 'Foo'}}
</code>

and like this:

<code>
    {{#iff answer '>' 40}}
</code>

In the sample I've created two templates. In the first template I used there are 3 such conditionals.
In the second template there is a single conditional: <hl>{{#iff 4 '*' 5}}</hl> that I included just to
show what will happen if we supply an operator that is not supported by the <hl>iff</hl> helper. I also added two buttons,
one to process and show the first template and one to process and show the second template.

<try file="examples/js/handlebars_conditionals.html">

The JavaScript file has the data, the code reacting to clicks and processing the templates and the the partial(!)
implementation of the <hl>iff</hl> helper. Basically it is just a giant <hl>switch</hl> statement with a separate
<hl>case</hl> for each valid operator. The <hl>default</hl> behavior, when the given operator is not handled
by any of the <hl>case</hl> statements, is to <hl>throw</hl> an exception.

<include file="examples/js/handlebars_conditionals.js">


<h2>#compare</h2>

After reaching this point I found out that there is already an implementation of such a helper called <hl>#compare</hl>.
It can be found among the <a href="http://assemble.io/helpers/helpers-comparison.html">comparison helpers</a>.

In any case I think it was interesting to see how to build and use this.
