In order to handle files Groovy has a class called <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/io/File.html">File</a>. Let's see some of the basic operations you can do with files.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/groovy/read_file.groovy">

<h2>Write a new file</h2>

This will remove the content of the old file and start a new file.

<include file=""examples/groovy/write_file.groovy">

This will append to the end of the file.

<include file="examples/groovy/append_file.groovy">


<h2>Write and Append</h2>

If we mix the calls to <hl>write</hl> and to <hl>append</hl> we'll get some strange results.
For example the following code will only store "third" in the file.

<include file="examples/groovy/write_append_file.groovy">

Don't do this!
