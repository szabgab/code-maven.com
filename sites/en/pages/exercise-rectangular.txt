<a href="/exercises">Exercise</a>: Calculate the area of a rectangular

=abstract end

Write a program that computes the area of a rectangular.

<ul>
  <li>Start by having two hard coded values. Multiply them and print the result. The result should be 42:
<code>
$ perl example.pl
42
</code>
  </li>
  <li>Then change the code to prompt the user for two numbers. Multiply them and print the result:
    <code>
    $ perl example.pl
    First number: 7
    Second number: 6
    42

    # ruby example.rb
    First number: 3
    Second number: 11 
    33
    </code>
  </li>
  <li>Further modify the program to warn if one of the numbers given was negative.
<code>
$ python example.py
First number: 3
Second number: -1
Warning: Invalid input. The side of a rectangular cannot be negative.
</code>
  </li>
</ul>
