We saw how take a <a href="/function-or-callback-in-python">simple function and using callbacks</a> make it more general.
We also saw how to <a href="/callback-or-iterator-in-python">create an iterator</a> to make our code more straight-forward.
This time we are going to see how to convert the plain function into a generator that,
after understanding how generators work, will seem to be the most obvious solution.

=abstract end

<h2>Plain function</h2>

As a reminder let's see the original plain Fibonacci function we started with,
that we had to change to hold our hard-coded condition, or in the more flexible
case that we had to make it execute a callback function.

<include file="examples/python/fibonacci_function.py">

<h2>Generator</h2>

<include file="examples/python/fibonacci_generator.py">

The example with the generator is almost exactly the same as the plain function,
and the way we can use it is exactly the same as we use the
<a href="/callback-or-iterator-in-python">iterator</a>

The only addition in the generator implementation of the <hl>fibonacci</hl>
function is that it calls <hl>yield</hl> every time it calculates one of
the values. This call pauses the execution of the <hl>fibonacci</hl> function
and returns the command to the calling entity together with the value passed
to the <hl>yield</hl> statement.

For the first iteration of the <hl>for</hl> loop the <hl>fibonacci</hl> function
will start running from its first statement assigning an empty list to <hl>values</hl>.

When it encounters the <hl>yield</hl> statement it will return the value in <hl>values[-1]</hl>
that will be assigned to <hl>f</hl> of the <hl>for</hl> loop and it will let the <hl>for</hl>
loop execute its code. There we can put any condition to break-out from the loop.

If we don't <hl>break</hl> on the first iteration then on the subsequent
iterations of the <hl>for</hl> loop the <hl>fibonacci</hl> function will continue
from the exact state where it was paused. Meaning the content of the <hl>values</hl>
will be exactly the same as it was left, and the first statement to be executed will be the one
immediately after the <hl>yield</hl> statement which, in this case, will be checking
if <hl>True</hl> is still true in the <hl>while(True):</hl> statement.

So from the outside the <hl>fibonacci</hl> function will behave just as the
<a href="/callback-or-iterator-in-python">Fibonacci iterator</a> does which
makes our code simple.
