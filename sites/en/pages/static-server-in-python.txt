When I've started to work on the <a href="https://codeandtalk.com/">Code And Talk</a>
site I did not know what I was building.  I actually started out by collecting data about podcasts. 
I did not use a database but I wanted to have some kind of a display.

So instead of creating a dynamic site I opted for a static site that can be generated by a
script and a few templates.

Such site can be served using Apache or Nginx, but on my development machine I don't have either of those.
So I wrote a small web server serving the static files.
