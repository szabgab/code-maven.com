=abstract start

When I teach Python I keep telling my students to avoid importing using <b>*</b>,
but it isn't always easy as there are many examples
on the Internet, some even in official documentation, using code like:

<code>
from tkinter import *
</code>

Instead of that it would be better to write:

<code>
import tkinter as tk
</code>

But why?

=abstract end

<h2>Automatic function overwriting</h2>

Let's sat you have this code:

<code>
from Amodule import *
from Bmodule import *
</code>

and you use the function <b>calc</b> from Amodule.

Then you upgrade Bmodule (an external module) and it starts to also provide a function called <b>calc</b>.
Maybe it is a helper function of Bmodule so it is not even documented.

Suddenly your code starts to use the function <b>calc</b> provided by Bmodule.

Python does not even complain, but this is not what you wanted.

So in general it is better to avoid this feature of Python.

In general it is better to be explicit what you are importing than implicit.

<h2>Tk - tkinter</h2>

Back to the tkinter example you might have some code like this:

<code lang="python">
from tkinter import *
</code>

and then your code uses keywords such as <b>Tk, Menu, Frame, Label, Button</b>.

It is better to explicitely import whatever you needs:

<code>
from tkinter import Tk, Menu, Frame, Label, Button
</code<

Even better (as in easier to read) is to import the <b>tkinter</b> module (with or without an alias):

<code>
import tkinter as tk
</code>

and then use the objects of tkinter with their full name:

<code lang="python">
tk.Tk   instead of Tk
tk.Menu instead of Menu
</code>
