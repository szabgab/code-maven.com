Exercise: Implement the <hl>wc</hl> command of Linux/Unix

See other <a href="/exercises">exercises</a>.

=abstract end

A sample execution of <hl>wc</hl> looks like this:

<code>
$ wc *
      11      34     249 README.pod
       2       4     128 authors.txt
      37     110     773 check_examples.pl
wc: examples: read: Is a directory
    2737    2738   27627 python_weekly.pickle
wc: sites: read: Is a directory
       9      15     149 sites.yml
wc: static: read: Is a directory
    2796    2901   28926 total
</code>

That is. Given a list of things on the command line it counts the number of "lines", "words", and "characters" for each file
printing them in 3 columns (in that order) followed by the name of the file.

At the end it will print the totals of each column.

If it encounters something that is not a file (e.g. a directory) it prints a warning and goes on.

In our case there were 3 directories 'examples', 'sites', and 'static'.

Optionally allow the user to supply any of the 3 flags: <hl>-l</hl> to print the line count, <hl>-w</hl> to print the word count, or <hl>-c</hl> to print the charater count.
By default it prints all 3.

If no input file is provided, <hl>wc</hl> will work on the content arriving on the Standard Input. This means we can write this:

<code>
$ find . | wc -l
</code>

and get back the number of file in the directory tree starting in our current working directory.
