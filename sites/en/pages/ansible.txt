<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> is one of the leading Configuration Management systems.
It allows you to describe the expected state of your servers one-by-one or grouped by their task and then
it ensures all the servers are in the correct state only relying on standard ssh access.

No agent is required on the host. You only need to install Ansible on the computer(s) from which you wish to manage
your servers.

In this series we are going to look at various features of Ansible.
