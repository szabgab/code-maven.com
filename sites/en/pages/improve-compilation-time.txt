In order to improve the speed of software development one needs to be able to create faster development cycles and provide a shorter feedback loop. One of the ways to improve the development cycles is to reduce the time it takes to compile the project - if it is in a language where compilation is necessary.

The Linux kernel has 20 million lines of C code and I've just compiled in in 36 minutes on an old 4-core machine. PostgreSQL has 1 million lines of code and most of the build farm machines report 8-12 minute build time.

How long does it take to compile your software?

<h2>How long does it take to compile the Linux kernel?</h2>

The Linux kernel has about 20 million lines of C code according to both the
<a href="https://www.linuxcounter.net/statistics/kernel">Linux counter</a> and the
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/linux">OpenHub for Linux</a>.

The compilation time will largely depend on the the configuration you have, so this number
is not representative but I've just compiled it on an old 4-core machine and this is what <hl>time</hl> reported:

<code>
real    36m49.545s
user    130m15.245s
sys     9m35.052s
</code>

So it used the 4 cores very well and it took 36 minutes to compile the kernel.

<h2>How long does it take to compile PostgreSQL?</h2>

According to the <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/postgres">OpenHub on PostgreSQL</a> it has about 1 million lines of C code.

Most of the machines in the <a href="https://buildfarm.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL build farm report around 12-14 minutes. That includes both compilation and testing! Some machines took longer and a few ran in 8 minutes. I assume the differences are primarily due to the number of cores used in parallel.
