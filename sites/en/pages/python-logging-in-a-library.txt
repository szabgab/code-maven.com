You can add logging code to a library like in this excample:

<include file="examples/python/loglib/lib.py">

and it will not bother the person who uses the library without enabling any logging like this code:

<include file="examples/python/loglib/use_without.py">

The output will look like this:

<code>
$ python examples/python/loglib/use_without.py
before
after
</code>


If the user enabled logging, then that logging will be also included.

<include file="examples/python/loglib/use_with.py">

<code lang="perl">
$ python examples/python/loglib/use_with.py
before
DEBUG:root:hello
after
</code>
