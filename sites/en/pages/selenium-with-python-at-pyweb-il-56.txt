=abstract start

On 5 September 2016 I gave a talk, or procesiely a live demonstration of Selenium IDE and
the Selenium Driver of Python at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyWeb-IL/">PyWeb-IL</a>.

These are some notes for the presentation.

We talked about <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a> the plugin for Firefox.

Mentioned the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepath/">FirePath</a> plugin to interogate a DOM using CSS selectors or XPath.

I've also mentioned the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en">Accessibility Developer Tools of Chrome</a> that has nothing to do with Selenium, but a recent interview I made, that will be published on the <a href="/cmos">CMOS podcast</a> inspired me to talk about. 

We looked at the test for the web site of <a href="http://dbs.bh.org.il/">Jewish Diaspora house</a>.
It is not written well, but it can give a few ideas. Especially to people who listened to the talk.

We also looked at the web site of the <a href="http://wellington.govt.nz/">Wellington City Council</a>
that has responsive-design, and we had a script to test the responsiveness, though we have not looked at it.
