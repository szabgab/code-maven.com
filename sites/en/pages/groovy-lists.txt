Square brackets <hl>[]</hl> create a list that implements the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html">List</a> interface.

By default it is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>
though you can create a list of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html">LinkedList</a> as well.

There are several ways to iterate over the elements of a list.

There is the old-school way of using a <hl>for</hl> loop. This is like in most of the other languages
uses a variable to go over the indexes from 0 to the size-1 and then use this index to access the real value
in the list. The name of this internal variable is typically i or j and it does not need to be declared using <hl>def</hl>.


The <hl>each</hl> method will also iterate over the elements of the list. For each iteration it will put the current value
in a variable called <hl>it</hl> and then execute the block that follows the <hl>each</hl> statement. The <hl>it</hl> is similar
to to <hl>$_</hl> of Perl and the <hl>_</hl> of Python.

Optionally we can set the name of this internal variable by providing it right after the opening <hl>{</hl> of the block,
followed by an arrow.

Finally, we can also use the <hl>eachWithIndex</hl> in which case we need to define the name of two variables.
The first one will get the current value, the second one will get the index of the current value.

<h2>Is element in list? How many times?</h2>

The <hl>count</hl> method will count how many times a values appears in a list. It can be used to check if the values is in the list at all.
