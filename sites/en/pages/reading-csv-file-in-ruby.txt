=abstract start

Ruby comes with a standard library called <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html">CSV</a> to make it easy to read
files with Comman Separated values

<h2>CSV file</h2>

In this CSV file the 3rd fields in every "row" is a number. We would like to sum these numbers.

<include file="examples/ruby/data.csv">

If it was a simpler file We could read it line-by-line and use <hl>split</hl> to cut it into parts,
but in this file there is a field that has a comman in it. Plain <hl>split</hl> would not be able to
handle the field enclosed in quote marks <hl>"</hl> containing a comma.

This file also has a field with an embedded newline. So the physical rows of the file, marked by <hl>\n</hl> newlines
are not the same as the logical lines that and good CSV parser would understand.

<include file="examples/ruby/add_third_column.rb">

In this example first we <b>load the CVS module</b> then we use the <hl>CVS.foreach(filename)</hl> construct
to iterate over the file loical row by logical row. On each iteration the variable <hl>row</hl> is going to be
an array. The third element can be accessed using index 2.  We have to convert the value to a number using
<hl>to_i</hl> and then we can add it to the variable <hl>sum</hl>
