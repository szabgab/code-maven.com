<a href="https://rpyc.readthedocs.io/">RPyC</a> provides remote procedure call, or more precisely,
<b>Remote Python Call</b> between two computers.

On both machines we need to have Python and the RPyC package installed and on the server we need to launch a process
before we can talk to it. The nice thing is that it runs on all the 3 major Operating systems: Linux, Mac OSX, and MS Windows,
and you can make RPyC between machines running different OS-es.

=abstract end


<h2>Install RPyC</h2>

It is simple just type

<code>
pip install rpyc
</code>

<h2>Run the RPyC server</h2>

Nothing special needed. just run the <hl>rpyc_classic.py</hl> script that came with the <hl>RPyC</hl> installation:

<code>
rpyc_classic.py
</code>

It will print something like this to the console, and then it will wait for a client to connect.
As the client access the server we will see further output appearing on the console.

<code>
INFO:SLAVE/18812:server started on [0.0.0.0]:18812
</code>


<h2>Simple module use</h2>

<include file="examples/python/rpyc_modules.py">

This example, as all the other examples here require the name or IP address of remote server on the command line.
So you'd run

<code>
python rpyc_modules.py remote_machine
</code>

If you wanted to run this on <hl>remote_machine</hl>

or you'd run

<code>
python rpyc_modules.py localhost
</code>

if you had only one computer and wanted to see how you can talk to yourself.

In this simple script we connect to a remote server using the following call:

<code lang="python">
conn = rpyc.classic.connect(server)
</code>

Then we can use the connection object stored in <hl>conn</hl> to execute commands on the remote server.

We can attache a local name to a remote Python object. For example this line connects the <hl>rsys</hl>
name on our client to the <hl>sys</hl> object on the server. (It automatically imports the <hl>sys</hl> module
on the server.)

<code lang="python">
rsys = conn.modules.sys
</code>

Once we have made that call we can use the <hl>rsys</hl> on the client just as we would use <hl>sys</hl>
on the server. For example we can access its attributes and print them on the console of the client:

<code lang="python">
print(rsys.version)
</code>

The same with the <hl>os</hl> module in the above code.

<h2>Persistent variables on the server</h2>

On the next example we use the <hl>execute</hl> and <hl>eval</hl> methods of the connection object.
The <hl>execute</hl> method will, execute arbitrary code on the server. In our example first we
create a variable with a new value. Then we change the content of the variable.

Finally we use the <hl>eval</hl> method to evaluate an expression and return the results.

<include file="examples/python/rpyc_variables.py">

The super nice thing is that it will take any data structure we have on the server and replicate it locally.
So in the second set of calls we create a dictionary on the server, we modify it, and then we copy it back to the client
using the <hl>eval</hl> method.

On the client we get a copy of the remote object.

Better yet, we can use the <hl>namespace</hl> attribute of the connection object
which is a dictionary where the keys are the object in on the remote server. For example the
variables we created there. Thus <hl>conn.namespace["scores"]</hl> refers to the object called
<hl>scores</hl> on the remote machine. We can access and even change the object and its attributes
with regular Python code like this:

<code lang="python">
conn.namespace["scores"]["Bar"] += 58
</code>


<h2>Remote exception handling</h2>

<include file="examples/python/rpyc_exception.py">

If an exception occurs on the server, it is printed to the console of the server
and the exception itself is propagated to the client.

Meaning that the last print-statement will not be executed.

You can catch the remote exception locally the same way you'd catch
local exceptions.

<h2>Upload code - run function</h2>

Based on the above example we could upload and <hl>execute</h> any Python code.
If that was a function definition then we would effectively create a new function on
the remote server which can be later executed.

For clarity I've moved the code that should be executed remotely to a separate file.
It is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci function:

<include file="examples/python/remote_code.py">

Then there is code that will load this file in the client as a plain text, then
call <hl>execute</hl> on the connection object to execute the function definition
on the remote machine.

After we executed the code, we can use the <hl>namespace</hl> attribute of the connection
to access the function and call it with any parameter.
