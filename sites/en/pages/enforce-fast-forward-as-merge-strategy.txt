Some people like to see lots of branches and the way they are merged together in their git history. Others like to have nice straight line.

Some companies have a development workflow in which the only way to add to the "master" branch is to send a pull-request, get it reviewed, approved and then merged into "master". For them it might be useful to enforce that merging into master can be done only with a fast-forward merge.

=abstract end

There are several ways to enforce it or at least to gently nudge you in the chosen direction.

<code>
git config --global merge.ff only
</code>

That will add an entry to your <hl>~/.gitconfig</hl> file:

<code>
[merge]
    ff = only
</code>

and it will require that you only merge branches that can fast-forward. That basically forces you to either rebase before merging, or turn off this configuration, or to force your way through using

<code>
git merge --no-ff
</code>

Alternatively you can execute the following command <b>while inside a git workspace</b>

<code>
git config --local merge.ff only
</code>

This will add the same entry to the <hl>.git/config</hl> of the current project.
This way the enforcing only happens in specific projects.

Of course all this is on the client side and not on the server.

<h2>Enforce fast-forward to a single branch only</h2>

Adding the following to the <hl>.git/config</hl> file of your project will enforce the "merge only with fast-forward" rule on the "master" branch only.

<code>
[branch "master"]
    mergeOptions = --ff-only
</code>

This is also describe by <a href="https://twitter.com/mvuksano">Marko Vuksanovic</a>

<h2>Team Foundation Server</h2>

TFS allows the admins to set 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/repos/git/branch-policies?view=vst">branch policies</a>. Among the several features one can <b>Enforce a merge strategy</b>, but as far as I can see only <b>No fast-forward merge</b> and <b>Squash merge</b> are available.


<h2>Atlassian BitBucket</h2>

The documentation seems to indicated that the admin of a project can set the
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/pull-request-merge-strategies-844499235.html">available merge strategies</a>, but all I managed to do was to set the default merge strategy. It indeed stopped me from accepting a pull-request that could not be merged using fast-forward. However I was still able to pick a different merge strategy when I was about to accept the pull-request.

Maybe I have not looked close enough.

<h2>GitHub</h2>

As far as I know GitHub does not support requiring fast-forward when you accept and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/">merge a pull-request</a>.

<h2>GitLab</h2>

As I can see one can set <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/fast_forward_merge.html">fast forward merge</a> as the only acceptable merge strategy.
