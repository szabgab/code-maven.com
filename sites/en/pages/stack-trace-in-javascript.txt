We have already seen 5 levels of <a href="http://code-maven.com/logging-in-javascript">logging in JavaScript</a>. Each one showed the line number where the
function was called. That's very nice, but if the same function can be called in multiple places then having
that context can improve your understand what has happened.

Printing a full stack trace can help a lot.

<h2>Using console.trace</h2>

Luckily the <hl>console</hl> object also has a method called <hl>trace</hl>.

In the following example we have a few totally useless functions calling each other and then
calling the <hl>add</hl> function, that calls <hl>console.trace</hl>.

<include file="examples/javascript/logging/logging_trace.js">

The output in <a href="http://code-maven.com/open-javascript-console">the JavaScript web console</a>
of Chrome looks like this:

<img src="http://code-maven.com/img/javascript_trace_in_chrome.png" alt="console trace in Chrome" />

In Firefox it looks like this:

<img src="http://code-maven.com/img/javascript_trace_in_firefox.png" alt="console trace in Firefox" />

If you'd like to try it yourself, here is the HTML that will load the above JavaScript file.

<try file="examples/javascript/logging/logging_trace.html">


<h2>Stack trace as a string</h2>

There are cases when you might not necessarily want to print the stacktrace immediately,
or you might even want to save it or send it to the server. For such cases, it would be nice
to be able to get a string version of the stack trace.

The following solutions are based on ideas found on
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/591857/how-can-i-get-a-javascript-stack-trace-when-i-throw-an-exception">this</a>
and <a href="http://ivan-gandhi.livejournal.com/942493.html">this</a> page.

<h2>Stack trace with Error object</h2>

In this solution we create and <hl>Error</hl> object and then return (and print)
the <hl>stack</hl> attribute.

The full JavaScript code looks like this:

<include file="examples/javascript/logging/logging_trace_with_error.js">

The corresponding HTML file is not very intersting, but it is included to make
it easier for you to try it:
<try file="examples/javascript/logging/logging_trace_with_error.html">

The output in Chrome:

and in FireFox:

<h2>Stack trace using caller object</h2>

In this solution we have implemented a function called <hl>stacktrace</hl>
that will return a string representing the call history to the point
where <hl>stacktrace()</hl> was called.

Internally it uses another function called <hl>st2</hl> that will be called
recursively traversing the call-tree up till the point where we reach the main
body of our JavaScript script.

<include file="examples/javascript/logging/logging_stacktrace.js">

At the end of the declaration of <hl>stacktrace</hl> we call <hl>st2</hl>
with the <hl>arguments.callee.caller</hl>.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments">arguments</a> is
a special object that belongs to the current function call and that contains a lot of
information about the current call. For example the <hl>callee</hl> attribute refers to the
currently executing function which is <hl>stacktrace</hl>.

We can probably replace <hl>return st2(arguments.callee.caller);</hl>
by <hl>return st2(stacktrace.caller);</hl>, but then we repeat the function name which
will make it harder to rename the function.

the <hl>st2</hl> function is then called recursively and it returns the stacktrace string so far.
When it reaches the top-most function call (in our case <hl>main</hl>) the next recursive call
will be with an <hl>undefined</hl> value received from <hl>f.caller</hl>. That will make it
return an empty string without further recursive calls.

If <hl>f</hl> is not yet <hl>undefined</hl> we build up the current call at the current
level of the stacktrace.
We use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments">arguments</a>
object of the current function. Because it is not a real Array we cannot use <hl>join</hl> and we have to
loop over the elements to build up the list of arguments received by this call. That's what is saved
in the <hl>args</hl> array.

<hl>f.toString()</hl> returns the string representation of the function <hl>f</hl>.
Each such string representation starts with <hl>function some_name(param, param) {</hl>.
<hl>split('(')</hl> cuts that string at the <hl>(</hl> characters in the source code of
the function, including the first <hl>(</hl> in the argument declaration.

The <hl>[0]</hl> means we take the first element from the returned array. That returns
<hl>function some_name</hl>. Calling <hl>substring(9)</hl> take all the characters
except the first 9 and returns that string. The returned string is the name of the
function. In our example it is <hl>some_name</hl>. That's how we can extract the name
of the currently called function.

Now that we have both the name of the current function and the list of parameters it
received we can create a string that represents the call.

The result looks like this in Chrome:

and this in FireFox:
