=abstract start

There are tons of cases when we are looking for a value in a list of elements and would like to 
be able to indicate when we could not find that value.

In most of the languages it is a bit cumbersome.

=abstract end

<h2>Find the first match</h2>

For example this very simple example in which we are looking for an even number:

<include file="examples/python/for_else/find_even_number.py">

If we run this program it will set the name <hl>even</hl> to be 4 which is what we wanted.

The problem is that if there is no match (there is no even number) then the variable <hl>even</hl>
will never get a value and thus it will be undeclared.

<include file="examples/python/for_else/no_even_number.py">

Running this program will result in the following exception:

<code>
$ python no_even_number.py

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "no_even_number.py", line 8, in <module>
    print(even)
NameError: name 'even' is not defined
</code>

<h2>Default value outside the loop</h2>

One solution to this problem employed in most programming languages is to
set a default value to the <hl>even</hl> variable before we enter the loop.
That way if we pass all the values without finding a match, the variable <hl>even</hl>
already has a value:

<include file="examples/python/for_else/default_result.py">

<code>
$ python default_result.py

None
</code>


<h2>for-else</h2>

A more elegant way that can be written in Python is the use of <hl>else</hl> after the <hl>for</hl>-loop.

<include file="examples/python/for_else/for_else.py">

The code in the <hl>else</hl> part will be executed if the loop has finished normally, without calling <hl>break</hl>.

That mean if we find a match during our loop, assign it to <hl>even</hl> and leave the loop calling <hl>break</hl>
then the <hl>else</hl> part won't be executed.

Together with the name- or variable-scoping of Python this will result in the same effect, but in my humble opinion
a more elegant way.
