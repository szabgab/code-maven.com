This is part of the <a href="/svg">SVG Tutorial and exercises</a> adding linear gradient to a rectangle in SVG.

Gradient is when in an area the color gradually changes from one color to another color. In this article we'll look
at <b>linear gradient</b> when the color changes along a straight line. We are going to fill a rectangle shape using
the changing color.

Normally, as you can see in the <a href="/svg-rectangle">basic rectangle examples</a> we can call the <hl>fill</hl> method,
pass an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a> value to it and have it filled by that color.
<hl>$shape->fill('#F0F0F0')</hl>. Alternatively we could call the <hl>attr</hl> method: <hl>$shape->attr({ 'fill' : '#F0F0F0' })</hl>.

Instead of a fix color, we can pass a gradient to the <hl>fill</hl> method, and let SVG fill the shape with that changing color.

<h2>White to Black top to bottom</h2>

In the first example we create a linear gradient using the <hl>gradient</hl> method. The first argument is just the string <hl>'linear'</hl>,
the second argument is a function setting the color values at various points along a linear line going from 0 to 1. We can supply several
colorts in that range, but we should supply at least the two end-points. If we only supply one color, SVG will use that single color
to fill the whole shape. No gradient will be used. Getting back to our first example: we set the color to be '#FFF' (which is just a short-hand for
'#FFFFFF') which is <b>white</b> at the begining of the 0-1 line. We also set the color to be '#000' (which is a short-hand for '#000000')
which <b>black</b> at the end of the 0-1 line. The whole construct is assigned to an arbitrary variable we called <hl>gr</hl>.

We can then map the 0-1 line onto the corners of the rectangle.  The <hl>from</hl> method connects the beginning of the 0-1 line to the coordinates (0, 0)
of the rectangle that mark the top left corner. The <hl>to</hl> method connects the end of the 0-1 line to the coordinates (0, 1) of the rectangle
that marks the bottom left corner.  (Actualy in both the <hl>from</hl> and <hl>to</hl> methods the first number sets the horizontal side 0 being left 1 being right;
the second coordinate sets the vertical side 0 being top, 1 being bottom.)

Once we configured our gradient, we can create a rectangle and use the variable <hl>gr</hl> that holds the gradient as the value of the <hl>fill</hl> attribute.

The <hl>stroke</hl> method is used to create a line around the rectangle. This helps us to see the edge of the rectangle.

<h2>White to Black corner to corner</h2>

In the next example I've changed two things. One is that we use the <hl>fill(gr)</hl> instead of <hl>attr({ 'fill' : gr })</hl>. This change
does not have any impact on the result, I made it only to show that we can use either syntax.

The real change is that the gradient goes now <hl>from(0, 0)</hl> (left, top), <hl>to(1, 1)</hl> (right, bottom). If you look at the
rectangle you'll see that the top left corner is white and the bottom right corner is black. Basically the 0-1 line of the gradiant was mapped to these two corners.

<h2>3 stop gradient</h2>

In this example we got back to the horizontal lines as we had it in the first example, but instead of 2 stop points we now have 3. The two end-points are both
'black', but at the 0.25 of the 0-1 line, meaning at one quarter from the top of the rectangle, we have a white horizontal line. The color changes from black
to white in the top quarter of the rectangle and then to black again in the lower 3/4 of the rectangle.

<h2>Blue gradient</h2>

In the next example we use a much smaller change in the gradient. This change in blue is pleasant to the eye.
Starting with a lighter blue on the left side it becomes dark on the right hand side.

<include file="examples/js/svg_rectangle_27.js">

<h2>4 directions</h2>

In the next 4 example you can see that the gradient can go between any two colors, in these cases the color changes
from '#FF0000' which is red, to '#0000FF' which is blue.

The 4 examples differ in their direction. (The <hl>from</hl> is always (0, 0) but the <hl>to</hl> has 4 different values.)
Notable might be the 4th example in which the value of <hl>to</hl> is the same as the value of <hl>from</hl> which causes
the whole rectangle to be a single color. Not very useful.
