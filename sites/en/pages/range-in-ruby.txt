=abstract start

Ruby has two operators to generate a range of values. <hl>..</hl> is inclusive and <hl>...</hl> is exclusive.

=abstract end

<h2>..</h2>

<include file="examples/ruby/range_two.rb">

Will generate

<code>
0
1
2
3
</code>

including the beginning and the end similar to how the range in Perl works.

<h2>...</h2>

If we use 3 dots instead of two, then the range
will include the lower limit, but not the higher limit.
Similar to how <hl>range</hl> in Python works.

<include file="examples/ruby/range_three.rb">

<code>
0
1
2
</code>


<h2>reverse range</h2>

If the limit on the left hand side is higher than on the right hand side,
the range operator won't return any values.

<include file="examples/ruby/range_two_wrong.rb">

It does not return any value.

As an alternative we can create a growing list of number and then call the <hl>reverse</hl> method on them.
For this however first we need to convert the rnage to an array:

<include file="examples/ruby/range_two_reverse.rb">

printing:

<code>
7
6
5
4
</code>


<h2>Range of letters</h2>

In additonal to ceating ranges of numbers, Ruby can also create a range of letters:

<include file="examples/ruby/range_letters.rb">

<code>
a
b
c
d
</code>

<h2>Range of characters</h2>

Not only that, but we can use any two characters in the visible part of the ASCII table:

<include file="examples/ruby/range_chars.rb">

<code>
Z
[
\
]
^
_
`
a
</code>


<h2>Range with variables</h2>

We can also use variables as the lower and upper limits:

<include file="examples/ruby/range_var.rb">
