While trying to enable GitHub Actions CI to this small Python package called <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/once-utils/">once-utils</a> I bumped into two issues:

1. Some of the tests required <b>gradle</b> to be installed, somehting that seemed arbitrary and not very straigh forward to have.

2. There was no easy way to install all the dependencies. (No requirements.txt file)

See the <a href="https://pydigger.com/stats">PyDigger stats page</a> for more modules that don't have Continuous Integration.

As I did not want to fiddle with the installation of gradle I decided that instead of running <b>pytest</b> and expecting it to find all the tests file,
for the initial Pull-Request I'll list the test files I'd like to be checked. Not ideal, but I think it is better to go in small steps than to
be stuck in-front of a big step. So the command I used was

<code>
pytest -vs tests/test_iter.py tests/test_random.py
</code>

The ideal way to find out the dependencies was creating a separate virtual envioronment locally and trying to run the tests locally.
I was lazy and did not do that so I had to add them one-by-one as GitHub Actions reported failures. Luckily there were only 2 missing dependencies
besides <b>pytest</b>.


I ended up adding a <b>requirements.txt</b> file with the following lines in it:

<code>
httpx
requests
</code>

And adding the following file as <b>.github/workflows/ci.yml</b>

<include file="examples/once-utils-ci.yml">

I also had to disable testing on Windows as that was failing and I also removed the testing on Python 3.11.0 RC 2, though that turned out to be a misunderstanding on my behalf
so I added it back.
