Recursive functions are functions that call themselves.

In many cases using recursive functions greatly simplifies the code we need to write.

For example when traversing some tree-like data structure.

One critical point in every recursive function is that there most be some <b>stop-condition</b>,
that will not create further recursive calls. Otherwise we would end up in an infinite deep black hole.

<h2>Factorial in recursive</h2>

The mathematical expression <b>n!</b> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a>)
can be defined in the straigh forward way as: <b>1 * 2 * ... * n</b>
or in the recursive way:

<code>
1!     = 1
n!     = n * (n-1)!
</code>

In a similar fashion we can implement the calculation of <b>n!</b> in both ways. The second way is called recursive
definition and it is implemented with recursive function calls:

<include file="examples/groovy/factorial.groovy">

What we must not forget is that we need to check for the stop-condition (the n == 1) before the recursive call.

<h2>Fibonacci in recursive call</h2>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci series</a> is usually defined in a recursive formula:

<code>
f(1)        1
f(2)        1
f(n)        f(n-1) + f(n-2)
</code>

It can be implemented in this way:

<include file="examples/groovy/fibonacci.groovy">

<h2>Recursive</h2>

For this example we have created an imaginary tree-structure. A dependency tree. Each file lists its dependencies.

We start with the "main" file:

<include file="examples/data/dependencies/main.txt">

<include file="examples/data/dependencies/a.txt">

<include file="examples/data/dependencies/b.txt">

<include file="examples/data/dependencies/e.txt">


The script to traverse the tree in a recursive fashion is this:

<include file="examples/groovy/list_dependencies_recursive.groovy">
