=abstract start
Never use <hl>input()</hl> in Python 2. It is a security hazard!

=abstract end

<include file="examples/python/use_input.py">

Run the script.

Type in <hl>os.system("ls -l")</hl>

Can you feel the danger in that?

Not yet?

What if someone typed in <hl>os.remove(__file__)</hl>

That would remove the current python file.

What if instead of the <hl>ls -l</hl> in <hl>os.system("ls -l")</hl> 
someone typed in <hl>rm -rf /</hl>.

All your files would be gone before you know it.

The problem is that <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input">input(prompt)</a>
in Python 2 is the same as <hl>eval(raw_input(prompt))</hl> which means that after reading in the
content of the standard input, python will immediately try to evaluate it.

That's never a good idea. I don't know how Guido thought it would be a good idea to have this feature in the language.

Just remember:

<h2>Python 2</h2>

<hl>raw_input(prompt)</hl> and never <hl>input(prompt)</hl>

<h2>Python 3</h2>

<hl>input(prompt)</hl>
