<a href="/python">Python</a> has a built-in function called <hl>range</hl> that can easily generate a
a range of whole numbers. There is another built-in function call <hl>xrange</hl> that provides the
same result, but uses a lot less memory.

=abstract end

<h2>range and xrange</h2>

In the following 3 example we could replace <hl>range</hl> by <hl>xrange</hl> and receive the same result:

<include file="examples/python/range_3_7.py">

From the first number (3) till one before the second number (7):

<pre>
3
4
5
6
</pre>

<include file="examples/python/range_5.py">

If there is only one number, that will be the end number and the default start number
will be 0. Thus <hl>range(5)</hl> is the same as <hl>range(0, 5)</hl>

<pre>
0
1
2
3
4
</pre>

<include file="examples/python/range_step.py">

If there are 3 parameters, the first one is the 3 value becomes the "step" that defaults
to 1 if the 3rd parameter is not present. The result will be the following:

<pre>
0
2
4
</pre>

<h2>Variable holding a range</h2>

What if we would like to create a variable that will hold the range?
We can do that and it is quite simple with either <hl>range</hl>
or <hl>xrange</hl>

<code lang="python">
r = range(1000)
</code>

Then we can go over the elements:

<code lang="python">
for v in r:
    pass
</code>

or we can access them by index:

<code lang="python">
print(r[4])
</code>

<h2>Memory Size</h2>

The big difference is in the amount of memory they use:

<include file="examples/python/range-memory.py">

The variable holding the range created by <hl>range</hl> uses 80072 bytes
while the variable created by <hl>xrange</hl> only uses 40 bytes.

The reason is that <hl>range</hl> creates a list holding all the values while
<hl>xrange</hl> creates an object that can iterate over the numbers on demand.

<include file="examples/python/range-type.py">

<h2>Speed - Benchmarking range and xrange</h2>

The "cost" of the memory saving is that looking up indexes in xrange
will take slightly longer. This benchmark code that uses the <hl>timeit</hl>
module shows that the xrange version is 10% slower:

<include file="examples/python/range-benchmark.py">

The resulting numbers are:

<pre>
2.16770005226
2.35304307938
</pre>
