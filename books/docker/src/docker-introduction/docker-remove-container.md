# Remove Docker container


```
$ docker container rm 42bbb5394617
$ docker container rm blissful_knuth
```

Using the "CONTAINER ID" or the "NAMES" from the list given by ps.

Alternatielly, for historical reasons, we can also use the following command without the `container` subcommand:

```
$ docker rm
```
